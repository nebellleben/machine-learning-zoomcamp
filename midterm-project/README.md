### Problem Description

The goal of this project is to predict **students' academic performance** — specifically their **math, reading, and writing scores** — based on demographic and educational background factors such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course.

This predictive model can help educators identify students who may need additional support in specific subjects.
